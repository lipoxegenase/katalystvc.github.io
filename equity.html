## Equity Kickers

In select cases, Katalyst VC reserves the right to secure a small equity stake or warrant tied to loan milestones. This allows us to share in the upside of companies that scale rapidly after our support.

- Triggered if founders raise VC or reach specific growth benchmarks
- Typical equity: ~1%
