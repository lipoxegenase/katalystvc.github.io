## LP Capital & Fund Management

As we grow, we aim to raise funds from LPs (Limited Partners) to scale our microloan impact. Our model follows a traditional VC structure:

- 2% management fee annually
- 10â€“20% carried interest on returns
- Funds disbursed through vetted frameworks with full reporting
